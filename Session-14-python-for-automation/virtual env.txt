In python virtual environment is isolated environment which allows you
to install and manage dependencies for diffrent projects.

you can manage project packages seperately by avoiding conflicts.

-- benefits
keep packages isolated
prevent from version conflicts
for diffrent projects we can manage diffrent dependencies

How to do that

    python -m venv myenv

it will create folder named myenv containing full isolated python environment

Activate:
    myenv\Scripts\activate

once you run this script virtual environment is activated.

now you can install dependencies here.
pip install requests flask
***************************************************************
Incase If you are using wsl then activate must be under the bin folder.
here use below command to activate:  source myenv/bin/activate

for deactivate just type deactivate in bash.


******** Advanced dependency management *********
pipenv combining pip and virtual env for manage dependencies
it keep tracks of your packagesin pipfile and pipenv.lock file
it also simplifies dependency installation, version control and project sharing

how to use?

pip install pipenv

then whenever you want to install any dependencies in virtual environment
use below command: pipenv install requests

it will setup up virtual environment and also you can see 2 files
Pipfile and lock file

now to use this environment use: pipenv shell

if you run any command under the shell it will use virtual environment

Let's Set up same in wsl
-------------------------------------
sudo apt update
sudo apt install pipenv 
once its installed check version: pipenv --version

create virtual environment: pipenv install -r requirements.txt

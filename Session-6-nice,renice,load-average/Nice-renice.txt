nice is used to start a process with some specified priority
renice is used to change the priority of existing process.
Each Process has a nice value ranging from -20 to 19

-20 (Highest Priority)
 19 (Lowest Priority)

 By default new process start with nice value 0.

  to check we can run top command.

you can see priority is 20 and nice value is -1 then priority becomes 19.

Higher the value means having low priority
(the process is nicer then others)

Lower the nice value means Higher Priority
(requires root access for negative values)

Start a script with nice value 10:
 nice -n 10 script-name

Let's Create script:
mkdir developers
cd developers
nano myscript.sh
----------------------------
#! /bin/bash
echo "Start My Script with Priority $(nice)"
sleep 100 ## Just wait for 100 seconds
echo "Script Completed Successfully"

to save --> ctrl+O and then press enter 
then --> ctrl + X

check the content written: 
cat myscript.sh

to start a script with default priority:
sh myscript.sh & (& to run it in background)
to exit: ctrl+c (but still your process must be running)

to check the nice value: jobs -l (to see process id)

then: top -p process-id (top -p 1250)
you can see the nice and priority values

once the the process Completed ctrl+c

run it again with nice: nice -n -10 sh myscript.sh &
(ctrl+c) check proces id and then check priority values.

again you can check: top -p process-id
(you can see the priority 30)

now to update priority you can use renice:
sudo renice -10 proces-id 

top -p proces-id (priority must be updated)

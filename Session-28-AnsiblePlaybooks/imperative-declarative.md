# Imperative vs Declarative Approach

1. Imperative: 
    - tell how to do with step by step instruction (how to achiche that we need to tell)
    - Explicit control
    - eg. bash script, C, Python
2. Declarative: 
    - tell what to do and expected result (it figures out how to achieve it)
    - implicit control
    - eg. SQL, HTML, Ansible, Terraform

**Summary**
- Imperative: Do this, then this, than that...
- Declarative: I want this state at the end, you figure out how.

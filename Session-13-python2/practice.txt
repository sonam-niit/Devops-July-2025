1. from your slides create code for server.py
run the same and check output.

2. create class Account with variables accNo,accholderName,balance
   function:
        __init__(self,accNo,accHolderName,balance)
        display(self): provide details of Account
        diposit(self,amount): update balance by adding amount
        withdraw(self,amount): check if the sufficient balance available 
            withdraw the amount and decrease balance
            if no balance available then provide message.

3. from slides again try to run Dod class code and get handon practice.

4. from slides create Animal class
    create Dog class which inherits Animal class property

    create generic object of Animal 
    create Dog object and see the out of speak method

    Dog class overriding speak method so dog objetc will use its own method
    its not using parent class method.

5. from slides create demos for regex

    match pattern
    search pattern also for
    findall and sub

*** Whatever the programs I have shown to you
